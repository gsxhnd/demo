# Copilot Instructions for Astro Website

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Astro 5.x static site built with the "basics" starter template. The project uses TypeScript with strict type checking and follows Astro's file-based routing system.

## Architecture & File Structure

- **`src/pages/`** - File-based routing; each `.astro` file becomes a route (e.g., `index.astro` → `/`)
- **`src/components/`** - Reusable `.astro` components (zero JavaScript by default)
- **`src/layouts/`** - Layout wrappers using `<slot />` for page composition
- **`src/assets/`** - Imported images (use named imports, e.g., `import logo from '../assets/astro.svg'`)
- **`public/`** - Static files served directly (favicon, robots.txt, etc.)

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Component Structure

All components use Astro's **"frontmatter"** syntax:

```astro
---
// TypeScript code block (runs only server-side)
import Component from './Component.astro';
const title = 'Hello';
---

<!-- HTML template (rendered to static HTML) -->
<h1>{title}</h1>
<Component />

<style>
  /* Component-scoped CSS (auto-isolated) */
</style>
```

### Asset Imports

Always import static assets with named imports to get their resolved paths:

```astro
import astroLogo from '../assets/astro.svg';
<img src={astroLogo.src} alt="Logo" />
```

### TypeScript Configuration

- Uses `astro/tsconfigs/strict` - enforce strict type checking
- Include path: `.astro/types.d.ts` is auto-generated by Astro for type definitions

## Development Workflow

### Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start local dev server at `localhost:4321` (hot reload enabled)
- `npm run build` - Build to `./dist/` for production
- `npm run preview` - Locally preview the production build
- `npm run astro ...` - Run Astro CLI commands (e.g., `npm run astro add react`)

### No Build Complexity

This is a static-first project with minimal build configuration (`astro.config.mjs` is empty). Astro handles compilation automatically. Don't add unnecessary integrations without understanding the cost.

## Adding Features

### New Pages

Create `.astro` files in `src/pages/` directly; no router configuration needed.

### New Components

Store reusable `.astro` components in `src/components/` and import them into pages or layouts.

### External Dependencies

The project currently has zero dependencies besides `astro`. When adding packages, consider whether they're necessary—static generation is the default and JavaScript is opt-in.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Avoid** client-side interactivity by default; Astro generates static HTML. Use framework integrations (React, Vue) only when needed.
- **Import assets** correctly to resolve paths; don't use bare string paths.
- **CSS is scoped** to components automatically—no need for CSS modules or naming conventions.

## Documentation

Refer to [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build) for detailed guidance. The project structure matches the "Basics" template exactly.
